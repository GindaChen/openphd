      "description": "## Description\n\nAdd the ability for users to customize the left sidebar:\n\n1. **Toggle visibility** of each panel item (Home, Kanban, Agents, etc.)\n2. **Reorder panels** by dragging items up or down\n3. **\"More\" button** at the bottom of the sidebar that reveals hidden panels\n\n## Context\n\nThis was discussed as \"option B\" during the persistent agents implementation (PR #2). The current sidebar has fixed nav items. Power users may want to hide panels they don't use or reorder them.\n\n## Approach Options\n\n- **A (done)**: Quick wins shipped — settings moved to sidebar, agents nav added\n- **B (this issue)**: Add an \"Appearance > Sidebar\" section in Settings with toggles and drag-to-reorder\n\n## Design Notes\n\n- In Settings > Appearance, add a \"Sidebar Items\" subsection\n- Each item has a toggle (visible/hidden) and a drag handle\n- Persist order + visibility in localStorage via `settings.js`\n- Consider a \"more panels\" button at sidebar bottom for hiding overflow",
